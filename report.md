# ZAP Security Report

## Summary
**Date:** February 21, 2025  
**Target URL:** https://example.com  
**Scan Duration:** 30 minutes  
**Total Issues Found:** 5  

## Vulnerability Details

### 1. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- **Severity:** High
- **Affected URL:** https://example.com/login
- **Description:** The application does not properly validate user input, allowing malicious scripts to be injected and executed in the victim's browser.
- **Solution:** Implement input validation and sanitize user input.
- **Evidence:**
  ```html
  <script>alert('XSS');</script>
  ```

### 2. SQL Injection
- **Severity:** Critical
- **Affected URL:** https://example.com/search?q=
- **Description:** The application is vulnerable to SQL Injection, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary SQL queries.
- **Solution:** Use prepared statements and parameterized queries.
- **Evidence:**
  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = 'admin' OR '1'='1';
  ```

### 3. Insecure Cookies
- **Severity:** Medium
- **Affected URL:** https://example.com/dashboard
- **Description:** Cookies do not have the `Secure` and `HttpOnly` flags set, making them vulnerable to attacks.
- **Solution:** Set `Secure`, `HttpOnly`, and `SameSite` attributes for cookies.
- **Evidence:**
  ```
  Set-Cookie: sessionid=12345; Path=/; Domain=example.com;
  ```

### 4. Missing Security Headers
- **Severity:** Medium
- **Affected URL:** https://example.com/
- **Description:** Important security headers such as `X-Frame-Options`, `Content-Security-Policy`, and `Strict-Transport-Security` are missing.
- **Solution:** Implement proper security headers in HTTP responses.
- **Evidence:**
  ```
  X-Frame-Options: DENY (missing)
  ```

### 5. Directory Listing Enabled
- **Severity:** Low
- **Affected URL:** https://example.com/assets/
- **Description:** Directory listing is enabled, allowing attackers to browse files in the directory.
- **Solution:** Disable directory listing in the server configuration.
- **Evidence:**
  ```
  Index of /assets/
  ```

## Recommendations
1. **Fix XSS vulnerabilities** by validating and sanitizing all user input.
2. **Prevent SQL Injection** by using parameterized queries and prepared statements.
3. **Secure cookies** by setting `Secure`, `HttpOnly`, and `SameSite` attributes.
4. **Implement security headers** like `Content-Security-Policy`, `Strict-Transport-Security`, and `X-Frame-Options`.
5. **Disable directory listing** in the web server configuration.

## Conclusion
The scan identified several vulnerabilities that need to be addressed to enhance the security posture of the application. Prioritizing the remediation of high and critical severity issues is recommended.
