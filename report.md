# ZAP Updated Security Report

## Summary

- *Date:* February 20, 2025  
- *Target URL:* [https://example.com](https://example.com)  
- *Scan Duration:* 30 minutes  
- *Total Issues Found:* 6  

## Vulnerability Details

### 1. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- *Severity:* High  
- *Affected URL:* [https://example.com/login](https://example.com/login)  
- *Description:* The application does not properly validate user input, allowing malicious scripts to be injected and executed in the victim's browser.  
- *Solution:* Implement input validation and sanitize user input.  
- *Evidence:*  
  html
  <script>alert('XSS');</script>
  

### 2. SQL Injection
- *Severity:* Critical  
- *Affected URL:* [https://example.com/search?q=](https://example.com/search?q=)  
- *Description:* The application is vulnerable to SQL Injection, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary SQL queries.  
- *Solution:* Use prepared statements and parameterized queries.  
- *Evidence:*  
  sql
  SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = 'admin' OR '1'='1';
  

### 3. Insecure Cookies
- *Severity:* Medium  
- *Affected URL:* [https://example.com/dashboard](https://example.com/dashboard)  
- *Description:* Cookies do not have the Secure and HttpOnly flags set, making them vulnerable to attacks.  
- *Solution:* Set Secure, HttpOnly, and SameSite attributes for cookies.  
- *Evidence:*  
  
  Set-Cookie: sessionid=12345; Path=/; Domain=example.com;
  

### 4. Missing Security Headers
- *Severity:* Medium  
- *Affected URL:* [https://example.com/](https://example.com/)  
- *Description:* Important security headers such as X-Frame-Options, Content-Security-Policy, and Strict-Transport-Security are missing.  
- *Solution:* Implement proper security headers in HTTP responses.  
- *Evidence:*  
  
  X-Frame-Options: DENY (missing)
  

### 5. Directory Listing Enabled
- *Severity:* Low  
- *Affected URL:* [https://example.com/assets/](https://example.com/assets/)  
- *Description:* Directory listing is enabled, allowing attackers to browse files in the directory.  
- *Solution:* Disable directory listing in the server configuration.  
- *Evidence:*  
  
  Index of /assets/
  

### 6. User Agent Fuzzer
- *Severity:* Informational  
- *Affected URL:* http://0.0.0.0:8000/register  
- *Description:* The system responds differently based on various User-Agent headers, which could indicate security misconfigurations.  
- *Solution:* Ensure consistent responses for different User-Agents to prevent potential exploitation.  
- *Evidence:* 12 instances of different User-Agent strings causing response variations.

## Recommendations

- Fix XSS vulnerabilities by validating and sanitizing all user input.
- Prevent SQL Injection by using parameterized queries and prepared statements.
- Secure cookies by setting Secure, HttpOnly, and SameSite attributes.
- Implement security headers like Content-Security-Policy, Strict-Transport-Security, and X-Frame-Options.
- Disable directory listing in the web server configuration.
- Ensure consistent responses across different User-Agents to prevent potential fingerprinting or security misconfigurations.

## Conclusion

The scan identified several vulnerabilities that need to be addressed to enhance the security posture of the application. Prioritizing the remediation of high and critical severity issues is recommended. Retesting should be conducted after fixes are implemented to confirm resolution.
